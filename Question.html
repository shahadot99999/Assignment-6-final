            1.Template Literals <br>
            2.Template Strings  <br>
            3.String Templates  <br>
            4.Back-Tics Syntax  <br>
             <br>Template literals are enclosed by backtick (`) characters instead of double or single quotes.Along with having normal strings, template literals can also contain other parts called placeholders, which are embedded expressions delimited by a dollar sign and curly braces: ${expression}. The strings and placeholders get passed to a function â€” either a default function, or a function you supply. The default function just performs string interpolation to do substitution of the placeholders and then concatenate the parts into a single string.

            <p><span class="text-primary">MAP:</span>  map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element. map() calls a function once for each element in an array. map() does not execute the function for empty elements. map() does not change the original array,and return the value.</p><br><br>

            <p><span class="text-primary">ForEach:</span> The forEach method is also used to loop through arrays, but it uses a function differently than the classic "for loop". The forEach method passes a callback function for each element of an array together with the following parameters: Current Value (required) - The value of the current array element.</p><br><br>


            <p><span class="text-primary">Find:</span> The find() method is an Array. prototype method which takes in a callback function and calls that function for every item within the bound array. When the callback function evaluates to true , the method returns the current item and breaks the loop.</p><br><br>

            <p><span class="text-primary">Filter:</span> The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function. The filter() method does not execute the function for empty elements. The filter() method does not change the original array.</p>
